Install server
	Server (Apache), database (mariadb), PHP, Perl
	No further instructions as actual process not important (and also differs widly from system to system (*glares at linux*))

Acquire files from github

Setup files
	Files under webroot need to be in URL-root/mopsi_dev/mymopsi/[mymopsi files] structure. This is hardcoded.
	Make a copy of config-file, and rename new copy to config.ini, and move somewhere safe (dev: same dir; prod: secure location)
	Create a collections directory, where images will be stored (dev: anywhere; prod: secure location)

Edit original config.ini.php:
	In [Config]-section, edit config-location to where you stored the new copy
Edit new config.ini (stored in new location)
	In [Database]-section, change db-info needed for accessing
	In [Misc]-section:
		perl -> how perl is called from the command line (either just perl, or path to perl.exe)
		path_to_collections -> directory where you created collections directory, either relative or absolute is fine
		web_root_path -> where the website files are under the webroot (the part after top URL)
		gmaps_api_key -> API key gor Google Maps
	These values are not hardcoded, as they may differ for localhost/prod-env.

Create database (same name as in config.ini)
	As in, create a new database in for example phpmyadmin, with the same name
	as in config.ini [Database]-section `name`-variable.

Run database install script, under db-directory
	./db/install.php
	The script only creates tables, and two users. It does not create a database.
	If needed, cleaner.php deletes all collections (files included) and removes
	all tables. Use if needed for reset.
